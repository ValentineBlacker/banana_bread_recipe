 ## with very detailed instructions just in case you need them

Loosely based on [Betty Crocker's version](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/banana-bread/51427396-6764-4b0a-a73a-78c683c703d2 "good ol' Betty C")

### -Ingredients, with substitutions noted and also some rambling


#### hardware- bare minimum
+ spoon
+ butter knife
+ large bowl
+ liquid measuring cup (1/2 cup or larger)
+ 1 teaspoon
+ 1/2 cup dry measure
+ 9x5x3" bread pan (Different sized pans discussed in procedure section. Bread pans are available for very cheap in the baking aisles of supermarkets.)
+ your oven (sorry you do need an oven)
+ something to grease the pan with (oil, crisco, pam, bacon grease)

#### wet ingredients
+ 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
  + You can also use melted butter, or any combination of applesauce and butter. A bit of butter provides flavor, but beyond that applesauce is cheaper and gives the same result. I usually do 2 T of melted butter and make up the rest with applesauce.
+ 1/2 cup sugar (Brown, white, or a mix. Brown sugar has a nice flavor)
+ 2 eggs
+ 1/2 cup buttermilk
  + (this is just milk with a splash of an acid like vinegar or lemon juice. Any % milk is fine.)
+ 3-5 very ripe bananas. I usually buy these on clearance.

#### flavorings (optional. 1 tsp of any)
+ vanilla (strongly recommend)
+ cinnamon
+ matcha
+ instant coffee

#### dry Ingredients
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 1 tsp baking soda
+ 1 cup whole white wheat flour (whole white wheat is a triumph of science)
+ 1/2 c instant oats
+ 1/2 c yellow cornmeal
  + you can substitute the oats and/or the cornmeal with the same amount of your wheat flour. I like the texture they provide, the cornmeal in particular. Also you can say it's multigrain, if anyone asks (they won't).

#### mixins (optional. 1/2 - 1 cup of up to 2 of these.)
+ goodboy
  + chopped nuts
  + dried fruit (raisins, dried cranberries, currants etc)
  + shredded carrots
+ badboy
  + peanut butter chips
  + chocolate chips
  + mini marshmallows
+ crazyboy
  + gummy bears
  + reese's pieces
  + sprinkles!


### Procedure
 Move oven rack to low position so that tops of pans will be in center of oven. Pre-heat oven to 350Â°F.

 Mix the sugar and butter/applesauce in large bowl. Add the eggs, buttermilk, and flavoring and mix. Add bananas. If they're very soft you can mush them up with your spoon, or you can use a potato masher or mixer until they're pretty pulped up.

 Add salt, baking soda, and flour/s, and mix until just blended. Stir in any mix-ins. I really like pecans and dried cranberries, but please experiment. Pour into greased pan.

 Let's talk about pan options. You can use 1 9x5x3" pan, 2 8 1/2x4 1/2x2 1/2" pans, 4 mini-loaf pans, a cupcake/muffin pan (makes 12) or a mini muffin pan (makes 24). If you're making muffins, you can either use cupcake liners, or grease the cups really well and hope for the best. If you bring in banana muffins for your team, they may forget that you broke the build. No guarantees.

 The baking time will be shorter, the more the batter is divided. My single loaf is usually done in 60 minutes, but mini-muffins only take about 20. You may just have to check for doneness often the first couple times. Bread is done when it's golden brown on top, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Use common sense, if it looks gooshy it's probably not done.

 Wait until it cools and use a butter knife around the edges to release from the pan. You're done! Slice into pieces. Slather it with butter if it's Monday and you love death.
